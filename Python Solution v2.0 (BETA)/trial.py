"""
Dynamic topology
================
This example shows how to generate a topology, an event schedule and a traffic
matrix.
In this specific example we create a Waxman topology and create an event
schedule listing random link failures and restores and generate a static
traffic matrix.
This scenario could be used to assess the performance of a routing algorithm
in case of frequent link failures.
